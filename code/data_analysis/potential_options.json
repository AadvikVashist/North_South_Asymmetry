// North is right
// do the exact angle. 
// day limb and night limb is very diff
// limb darkening laws 


//1. figure out what the angle for North is in the iamge
//2. Shift the slants for whatever the angle is
//3. Save plots again
//4. For each cube figure the pixel value for titan end is (if emission is not between 0 and 90, get rid of it) percetnage distance from end
//5. Don't cut out any fits out
//6. Plot brightnes vs emission angle for each fit (each angle) 
//7. Get the paramters from the limb darkening laws (in the end he would want u1 and u2) - report u1 + u2 and u1 - u2
